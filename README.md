## Introduction

In this phase of the project, we’ll explore the functionality of the phpMyAdmin account that was configured via the command line in Linux. Our focus will be on user access, table structure, and account privileges.

 - [x] Table Structure Functionality - We ensured the table structure is correctly set up. We verified that the necessary tables exist and have the appropriate columns.

 - [x] Add New User Account Functionality - We were able to successfully add a New User Account using the following steps:
  1. Access phpMyAdmin through your web browser.
  2. Navigate to the “Users” section.
  3. Click on “Add user account.”
  4. Provide the necessary details (username, password, host, etc.).

 - [x] Editing User Account Privileges - We were successfully able to configure the privileges for the newly created user account. We coule grant appropriate permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) based on the user’s role and limit access to specific databases or tables if needed.
