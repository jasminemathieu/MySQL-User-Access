## Conclusion
In this project, I was able to successfully configure and complete a full cloud-native backup service and machine restore to 100% data availability in Azure. Both methods prove to be powerful on-premises data protection solutions, useful in events of service disruptions, accidental deletions or corruption of data. It's equally secure, scalable, and cost-effective as it is simple to architect, highly available, and resilient.
